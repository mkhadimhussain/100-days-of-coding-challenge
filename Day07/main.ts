//QUESTION 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of 
//mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that 
//creates a list containing these items.

let cities : string[] = ["Karachi", "Islamabad", "Peshawar", "Lahore", "Faislabad"];
//My try
console.log(`Famous cities of Pakistan are ${cities}`);

//Actual way
console.log("Famous cities of pakistan are ",cities);

//QUESTION 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates 
//             Objects containing these items.

{
    title : "THE HOBBIT",
    author : "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    yearpublished : 1937
