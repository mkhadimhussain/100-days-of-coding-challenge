            // a unary operator that reverses the sign

            // An operator is binary if it has two operands.
            let a = 1;
            let b = 3;

            // Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.
            // For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:
            alert(4 ** (1/2));  // 2 (power of 1/2 is same as the square root)
            alert(8 ** (1/3));  // 2 (power of 1/3 is same as a cubic root)

            // the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the 
            // operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
            // No effect on numbers
            let m = 1;

            // 2 + 2 is evaluated and then assigned to the variables on the left: j, h and g. 
            // At the end, all the variables share a single value.

            // Once again, for the purposes of readability it’s better to split such code into few lines:
            j1 = 2 + 2;
            h1 = j1;
            g1 = j1

            // Modify-in-place

            k = k + 5;
            k = k * 2;
            // This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:
            let k1 = 2;
            k1 += 5;   // now k1 = 7 (same as k1 = k1 + 5)
            k1 *= 2;   // now k1 = 14 (same as k1 = k1 * 2)
            alert(k1); // 14
            // Short “modify-and-assign” operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise 
            // operators: /=, -=, etc.

            // Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so 
            // they run after most other calculations:
            let z = 2;
            z *= 3 + 5;  // right part evaluated first, same as z *= 8
            alert(z);    // 16

            // Increment/decrement
            // Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.

            // Increment ++ increases a varable by 1
            let counter = 2;
            counter++;       // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
            alert(counter);  // 3

            // Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:
            let counter1 = 2;
            counter1--;       // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
            alert(counter1);  // 1
            // Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a 
            // value like 5++ will give an error.

            // The operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.
            // When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
            // The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.

            // The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old 
            // value (prior to increment/decrement).
            // Prefix form
            let num = 1;
            a1 = ++num;  // increment then returns the value
            alert(a1);   // 2

            // Postfix form
            let num1 = 1;
            b1 = num1++;  // also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to increment)
            alert(b1);    // 1

            // To Summarize:
            // If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in 
            // which form to use:
            let counterr = 0;
            counterr++;
            ++counterr;
            alert(counterr);  // 2, the lines above did the same

            // If we’d like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, 
            // we need the prefix form:
            let counter3 = 0;
            alert( ++counter3 ); // 1

            // If we’d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:
            let counter4 = 0;
            alert( counter4++ ); // 0

            // Increment/decrement among other operators
            // The operators ++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is
            // higher than most other arithmetical operations.
            let aa = 1;
            alert(2 * ++aa);  // 4
            // Compare with:
            let bb = 1;
            alert(2 * bb++);  // 2, because bb++ returns the "old" value

            // While reading code, a fast “vertical” eye-scan can easily miss something like 
            // counter++ and it won’t be obvious that the variable increased.
            // We advise a style of “one line – one action”:
            let counter5 = 1;
            alert( 2 * counter5 );
            counter5++;

            // Bitwise Operators
            // Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level 
            // of their binary representation.
            // The list of operators:
            // AND ( & )
            // OR ( | )
            // XOR ( ^ )
            // NOT ( ~ )
            // LEFT SHIFT ( << )
            // RIGHT SHIFT ( >> )
            // ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( >>> )

            // Comma
            // The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a 
            // comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.
            let y = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
            alert(y);  // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
            // Here, the first expression 1 + 2 is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, 
            // 3 + 4 is evaluated and returned as the result.

            // Comma has a very low precedence
            // Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so 
            // parentheses are important in the example above.
            // Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into 
            // a = 3, 7, then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored.
            // It’s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.

            // three operations in one line
            // for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) {
            // ...
            // }
            // Such tricks are used in many JavaScript frameworks. That’s why we’re mentioning
            // them. But usually they don’t improve code readability so we should think well 
            // before using them.

            // Task4
            // Fix the addition
            let number1 = prompt('First Number', 1);
            let number2 = prompt('Second Number', 2);
            alert(number1 + number2);  // 12  (plus Concatenates)

            // Solution
            // convert strings to numbers
            // using + before prompt
            let number3 = +prompt('First Number', 1);
            let number4 = +prompt('Second Number', 2);
            alert(number3 + number4);  // 3 

            // using + in alert
            let number5 = prompt('First Number', 1);
            let number6 = prompt('Second Number', 2);
            alert( +number5 + +number6 );  // 3
            // Using both unary and binary + in the latest code.
