            // Arrow function, the basics

            // There’s another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that’s often
            // better than Function Expressions.

            // It’s called “arrow functions”, because it looks like this:

            // let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;

            // In other words, it’s the shorter version of:

            // let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) {
            //     return expression;
            // };

            // Let’s see a concrete example:
            let sum = (a,b) => a + b;

            // This arrow function is a shorter form of :

            // let sum = function(a, b) {
            //     return a + b;
            // };
            alert(sum(2,3));  // Output: 5
            // As you can see, (a, b) => a + b means a function that accepts two arguments named a
            // and b. Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression a + b and returns the result.

            // If we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making
            // that even shorter.
            let double = n => n * 2;
            // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { retuen n * 2}
            alert(double(3));  // 6

            // If there are no arguments, parentheses are empty, but they must be present:
            let sayHi = () => alert('Hello');
            sayHi();

            // Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.
            // For instance, to dynamically create a function:
            let age = prompt('What is your age?', 18);

            let welcome = (age < 18) ?
                () => alert('Hello') :
                () => alert('Greetings');

            welcome();
            // Arrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but that quickly
            // changes as the eyes get used to the structure.

            // Multiline arrow function

            // The arrow functions that we’ve seen so far were very simple. They took arguments from
            // the left of =>, evaluated and returned the right-side expression with them.

            // Sometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements. In
            // that case, we can enclose them in curly braces. The major difference is that curly braces
            // require a return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does).
            
            let sum1 = (a, b) => {   // the curly braces opens a multiline function
                let result = a + b;  // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit "return"
                return result;
            };
            alert(sum1(2, 1));  // 3
            // brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an
            // explicit return to return something.

            // Task
            function ask(question, yes, no) {
                if (confirm(question)) yes();
                else no();
            } 

            ask(
                "Do you Agree?",
                () => alert('You Agreed.'),
                () => alert('You cancelled the execution.')
            );
