// Intersection Type
var person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 23,
    address: "123 Main St",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
};
// In this example, we have two types, FirstType and SecondType. We then create a new type
// CombinedType by using the & (intersection) operator, which combines the properties of both
// FirstType and SecondType. The CombinedType includes all properties from both types, allowing
// you to use them together.
