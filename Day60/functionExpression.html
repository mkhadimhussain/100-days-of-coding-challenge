            // Function Expression
            // The syntax that we used before is called a Function Declaration:
            function sayHi() {
                alert('Hello');
            }
            
            // There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.
            // It allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression.
            let sayHi1 = function() {
                alert("Hello");
            };
            // Here we can see a variable sayHi getting a value, the new function, created as function()
            // { alert("Hello"); }.
            // The meaning of these code samples is the same: "create a function and put it into the
            // variable sayHi1".

            // Function is a value

            // Let’s reiterate: no matter how the function is created, a function is a value. Both examples
            // above store a function in the sayHi variable.

            // We can even print out that value using alert:
            function sayHi2() {
                alert('Hello');
            }
            alert(sayHi2);  // Show the function code
            // The last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after sayHi. 
            // In JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above
            // shows its string representation, which is the source code.

            // Surely, a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like sayHi().
            // But it’s still a value. So we can work with it like with other kinds of values.

            // We can copy a function to another variable:
            function sayHi3() {    // Create
                alert('Hello');
            }

            let func = sayHi3;     // Copy
            //  Line (2) copies it into the variable func. Please note again: there are no parentheses
            // after sayHi. If there were, then func = sayHi() would write the result of the call sayHi()
            // into func, not the function sayHi itself.

            func();    // Hello    // run the copy (it works) 
            sayHi3();  // Hello    // This still works too (why would'nt it)

            // We could also have used a Function Expression to declare sayHi, in the first line:
            let sayHi4 = function() {
                alert('Hello');
            };

            let func1 = sayHi4;
            func1();  // Hello
            // Everything would work the same.

            // Function Expression is created here as function(…) {…} inside the assignment statement: 
            // let sayHi = …;. The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part
            // of the function syntax.

            // Callback functions

            // We’ll write a function ask(question, yes, no) with three parameters:
            // question
            // Text of the question
            // yes
            // Function to run if the answer is “Yes”
            // no
            // Function to run if the answer is “No”
            
            function ask(question, yes, no) {
                if (confirm(question)) yes()
                else no();
            }

            function showOk() {
                alert("You Agreed");
            }

            function showCancel() {
                alert("You cancelled the execution");
            }
            // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
            ask('Are you agreed?', showOk, showCancel);
            // The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.
            // The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary.
            // In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.

            // We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:
            function ask1(question, yes, no) {
                if (confirm(question)) yes()
                else no()
            }

            ask1('Are you agreed?',
                function() { alert('You Agreed'); },
                function() { alert('You cancelled the execution'); }
            );
            // Here, functions are declared right inside the ask(...) call. They have no name, and so
            // are called anonymous. Such functions are not accessible outside of ask (because they are
            // not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.

            // Such code appears in our scripts very naturally, it’s in the spirit of JavaScript.

            // A function is a value representing an “action”

            // Regular values like strings or numbers represent the data.
            // A function can be perceived as an action.
            // We can pass it between variables and run when we want.
            
            // Function Expression vs Function Declaration

            // Let’s formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.
 
            // First, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.

            // Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:
            function sum(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            // Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax
            // construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” =:
            let sum = function(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            // The more subtle difference is when a function is created by the JavaScript engine.
            /*
            A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.

            Once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment let sum = function… – here
            we go, the function is created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.

            Function Declarations are different.

            A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.

            For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.
            That’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for
            global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an
            “initialization stage”.

            And after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to
            these functions.      */

            // For example, this works:
            sayHi5('John');    // Hello, John

            function sayHi5(name) {
                alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
            }
            // The Function Declaration sayHi is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script
            // and is visible everywhere in it.

            // …If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn’t work:
            sayHi6('John');   // error

            let sayHi6 = function(name) {   // (*) no magic any more
                alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
            }
            // Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in
            // the line (*). Too late.

            // Another special feature of Function Declarations is their block scope.

            // In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere
            // inside that block. But not outside of it.

            // For instance, let’s imagine that we need to declare a function welcome() depending on the age
            // variable that we get during runtime. And then we plan to use it some time later.

            // If we use Function Declaration, it won’t work as intended:
            let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

            // conditionally declare a function
            if (age < 18) {
                function welcome() {
                    alert('Hello');
                }
            } else {
                function welcome() {
                    alert('Greetings!');
                }
            }
            // ...use it later
            welcome();  // Error: welcome is not defined
            // That’s because a Function Declaration is only visible inside the code block in which it resides.

            // Here’s another example:
            let age1 = 16;  // take 16 as an example

            if (age1 < 18) {
                welcome1();              // runs    (*)

                function welcome1() {
                    alert('Hello');
                }

                welcome1();              // runs    (*) = Function Declration is available everywhere in the 
                                         // block where it's declared.
            } else {
                function welcome1() {
                    alert('Greetings!');
                }
            }
            // Here we're out of curly braces,
            // so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.
            welcome1();  // Error: welcome1 is not defined

            // What can we do to make welcome visible outside of if?

            // The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign welcome to the
            // variable that is declared outside of if and has the proper visibility.

            // This code works as intended:
            let age2 = prompt('What is your age?', 18);

            let welcome2;

            if (age < 18) {

                welcome2 = function() {
                    alert('Hello');
                };
            } else {

                welcome2 = function() {
                    alert('Greetings!');
                };
            }

            welcome2();  // Ok now

            // Or we could simplify it even further using a question mark operator ?:
            let age3 = prompt('What is your age?', 18);

            let welcome3 = (age3 < 18) ? 
                function() { alert('Hello'); } :
                function() { alert('Greetings!'); };

            welcome3();  // Ok now

            // When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?

            // As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing to consider is
            // Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because
            // we can call such functions before they are declared.

            // That’s also better for readability, as it’s easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code
            // than let f = function(…) {…};. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.

            // …But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional
            // declaration (we’ve just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used.
