// Interface
// An interface in TypeScript is a way to define a contract or blueprint for the shape and
// structure of an object. It specifies the properties, methods, and their types that objects
// implementing the interface should have. In essence, an interface defines a set of rules that
// an object must follow to be considered valid according to that interface.
var John = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
};
// In this example, we define an interface "PersonEx1" with two properties: name (a string) and
// age (a number). We then create an object "John" that adheres to this interface.
// Interfaces are widely used in TypeScript for:
// - Defining the structure of data objects.
// - Specifying the shape of function parameters and return values.
// - Enforcing consistency in class definitions.
// - Facilitating code maintainability and collaboration.
