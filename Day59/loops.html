            // Loops
            // Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

            // The "while" loop
            // The while loop has the following syntax:
            while (condition) {
                // code 
                // so called "loop body"
            }
            // While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is executed.
            
            // For instance, the loop below outputs i while i < 3:
            let i = 0;
            while (i < 3) {  // Shows 0, then 1, then 2
                alert(i);
                i++;
            }
            // A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration. The loop in the example
            // above makes three iterations.

            // If i++ was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever.
            // In practice, the browser provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript,
            // we can kill the process.

            // A shorter way to write while (j != 0) is while (j):
            let j = 3;
            while (j) {  // When j becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops.
                alert(j);
                j--;
            }

            // Curly braces are not required for a single-line body
            // If the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the curly braces {…}:
            let k = 3;
            while(k) alert(k--);

            // The "do...while" loop

            // The condition check can be moved below the loop body using the do..while syntax:
            do {
                // loop body
            } while (condition);
            // The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it’s truthy,
            // execute it again and again.
            // For Example:
            let a = 0;
            do {
                alert(a);
                a++;
            } while (a > 3);  // 0, 1, 2
            // This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute at
            // least once regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred:
            // while(…) {…}.

            // The "for" loop
            // The for loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.
            for (begin; condition; step) {
            // ... loop body ...
            }

            // The loop below runs alert(i) for i from 0 up to (but not including) 3:
            for (let b = 0; b < 3; b++) {
                alert(b);
            }
            // Inline variable declaration
            // Here, the “counter” variable i is declared right in the loop. This is called an “inline” 
            // variable declaration. Such variables are visible only inside the loop.
            for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            alert(i); // 0, 1, 2
            }
            alert(i); // error, no such variable

            // Instead of defining a variable, we could use an existing one:
            let c = 0;
            for (let c = 0; c < 3; c++) { // use an existing variable
                alert(c);  // 0, 1, 2
            }

            alert(c); // 3, visible, because declared outside of the loop.

            // Skipping parts
            // Any part of for can be skipped.
            // For example, we can omit begin if we don’t need to do anything at the loop start.
            // Like here:
            let m = 0;  // we have m already declared and assigned
            for (; m < 3; m++) { // no need for begin
                alert(m);  // 0, 1, 2
            }

            // We can also remove the stop part:
            let n = 0;
            for (; n < 3;) {
                alert(n++);
            }
            // This makes the loop identical to while (n < 3).

            // We can actually remove everything, creating an infinite loop:
            for (;;) {
                // repeats without limits
            }
            // Please note that the two for semicolons ; must be present. Otherwise, there would be
            // a syntax error.

            // Breaking the loop
            // Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.
            // But we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.

            // For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no
            // number is entered:
            let sum = 0;
            while (true) {
                let value = +prompt('Enter a number', '');

                if (!value) break;  // (*)

                sum += value;
            }
            alert('Sum: ' + sum);
            // The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or
            // cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line
            // after the loop. Namely, alert.

            // The combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s
            // condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or
            // even in several places of its body.

            // Continue to the next iteration

            // The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn’t stop the whole loop.
            // Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the
            // condition allows).

            // We can use it if we’re done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the
            // next one.

            // The loop below uses continue to output only odd values:
            for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
                // if true, skip the remaining part of the body
                if (y % 2 == 0) continue;

                alert(y);  // 1, 3, 5, 7. 9
            }
            // For even values of i, the continue directive stops executing the body and passes control
            // to the next iteration of for (with the next number). So the alert is only called for odd 
            // values.

            // The continue directive helps decrease nesting
            // A loop that shows odd values could look like this:
            for (let z = 0; z < 10; z++) {
                if (z % 2) {
                    alert(z); // 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
                }
            }
            // But as a side effect, this created one more level of nesting (the alert call inside the
            // curly braces). If the code inside of if is longer than a few lines, that may decrease the
            // overall readability.

            // No break/continue to the right side of ‘?’
            // Please note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the
            // ternary operator ?. In particular, directives such as break/continue aren’t allowed there.

            // For example, if we take this code:
            if (i > 5) {
                alert(i);
            } else {
               // continue;
            }

            // and rewrite it using a question mark:
            // (1 > 5) ? alert(i) : continue;  // continue isn't allowed here
            // it stops working: there’s a syntax error.
            // This is just another reason not to use the question mark operator ? instead of if.

            // Labels for break/continue

            // Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.
            // For example, in the code below we loop over i and j, prompting for the coordinates
            // (i, j) from (0,0) to (2,2):

            for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                    let input = prompt(`Value at coords ${i}, ${j}`, '');

                    // What if we want to exit from here to done (below)?
                }
            }
            alert('Done');
            // We need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.

            // The ordinary break after input would only break the inner loop. That’s not sufficient
            // – labels, come to the rescue!

            // A label is an identifier with a colon before a loop:
            // labelName: for (...) {
            // ...
            // }

            // The break <labelName> statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:
            outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

                    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

                    // if an empty string or cancelled, then break out of both loops
                    if (!input) break outer;  // (*)

                    // do something with the value...
                }
            }
            alert('Done');
            // In the code above, break outer looks upwards for the label named outer and breaks out
            // of that loop.
            // So the control goes straight from (*) to alert('Done!').

            // We can also move the label onto a separate line:
            // outer:
            // for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }

            // The continue directive can also be used with a label. In this case, code execution jumps
            // to the next iteration of the labeled loop.

            // Labels do not allow to “jump” anywhere
            // Labels do not allow us to jump into an arbitrary place in the code.

            // For example, it is impossible to do this:
            // break label; // jump to the label below (doesn't work)
            // label: for (...)
            // A break directive must be inside a code block. Technically, any labelled code block will
            // do, e.g.:
            label: {
            // ...
            break label; // works
            // ...
            }
            // …Although, 99.9% of the time break is used inside loops, as we’ve seen in the examples above.
            // A continue is only possible from inside a loop.

            // Task 1:
            let l = 3;
            while (l) {
            alert( l-- );
            }                // 3, 2, 1
            // let i = 3;
            // alert(i--); // shows 3, decreases i to 2
            // alert(i--) // shows 2, decreases i to 1
            // alert(i--) // shows 1, decreases i to 0
            // // done, while(i) check stops the loop

            // Task 2: Which values does the while loop show?

            // Both loops alert the same values, or not?

            // The prefix form ++i:
            let s = 0;
            while (++s < 5) alert( s );  // 1, 2, 3, 4 
            // ++i first increments i and then returns the new value.

            // The postfix form i++
            let w = 0;
            while (w++ < 5) alert( w );  // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
            // The first value is again i = 1. The postfix form of i++ increments i and then returns
            // the old value, so the comparison i++ < 5 will use i = 0 (contrary to ++i < 5).

            // But the alert call is separate. It’s another statement which executes after the increment
            // and the comparison. So it gets the current i = 1.

            // Task 3: Which values get shown by the "for" loop?

            // Both loops alert same values or not?
            // The postfix form:
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );  // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

            // The prefix form:
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );  //0, 1, 2, 3, 4

            // Task 4: Output even numbers in the loop
            // Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.
            for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
                if (i % 2 == 0) {

            }

            // Task 5: Replace "for" with "while"

            // should stay same).
            let v = 0;

            } while (num <= 100 && num);
            // The loop do..while repeats while both checks are truthy:

            // The check for num <= 100 – that is, the entered value is still not greater than 100.
            // The check && num is false when num is null or an empty string. Then the while loop stops too.
            // P.S. If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop wouldn’t stop
            // if the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.

            // An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder
            // by anything except 1 and itself.

            // In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
